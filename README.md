## Overview

**SmartER** is an innovative kiosk system developed by **Team 3K** from Singapore Polytechnic. It leverages Artificial Intelligence to optimize and automate tasks within a hospital's Emergency Room, such as patient triaging and bed allocation. By doing so, SmartER enhances the efficiency of manpower allocation and significantly reduces patient waiting times. The system gathers patient data through smart sensors, and all critical information is easily accessible to healthcare professionals via a dedicated web application.
