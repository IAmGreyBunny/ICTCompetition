UTIs are usually treated with antibiotics.Patients with UTIs may experience a variety of symptoms, including a burning sensation when urinating, pain in the lower abdomen, pelvic pain, cloudy or bloody urine, and a strong urge to urinate even when there is little urine present.If a UTI is left untreated, it can spread to the kidneys and cause a more serious illness.",2

For instance, if a patient has a chemical burn from ammonia, their current burn levels would be much more serious than if they had a chemical burn from dishwashing detergent.Chemical burn levels are also classified according to the depth of the burn. A first-degree burn is the most superficial and only affects the outer layer of skin. Second-degree burns affect both the outer and inner layers of skin, while third-degree burns penetrate the deepest layer of skin and may damage muscle and bone.Chemical burn levels will also vary depending on the amount of chemical that was spilled. A small amount of chemical may only cause a first-degree burn, while a large amount of chemical may cause a third-degree burn.Finally, the age and health of the patient also play a role in chemical burn levels. Young children and elderly patients are more prone to developing more serious chemical burns.",1

", as well astreatment and advice for patient care.A sprain is a tear or stretch in a ligament, the tough band of tissue that connects bones to each other. Ligaments stabilize joints and keep them from moving too far. Sprains can be caused by a sudden twisting motion or fall, a blow to the joint, or overuse.There are three grades of sprains:Grade 1. The ligament is mildly stretched and some swelling and discomfort may occur.Grade 2. The ligament is partially torn and significant swelling and bruising may occur.Grade 3. The ligament is completely torn and may require surgery. There is a high likelihood of chronic instability and deformity in the joint.If you suspect you have a sprain, stop using the joint and apply ice. Ice should be applied for 15-20 minutes every 2-3 hours for the first 48-72 hours. Rest the joint and elevate it above the level of your heart as often as possible. Take over-the-counter pain medication if needed.See your doctor if the pain or swelling does not improve after a few days, if you cannot move the joint, or if you feel a pop",2
