"A patient has a current urinary tract infection (UTI). UTIs are very common, and most are caused by bacteria that enter the urinary tract through the urethra and travel up to the bladder. UTIs can cause pain and a burning sensation when urinating, an urge to urinate often, and cloudy or bad-smelling urine. In some cases, a fever may develop. If a UTI is not treated, it may spread to the kidneys.UTIs are usually treated with antibiotics. The most common antibiotics used to treat UTIs are called quinolones. These antibiotics are usually taken by mouth. However, in some cases, they may also be given through a vein (intravenously) or directly into the bladder (intravesically).It is important to take all of the antibiotics prescribed, even if the person begins to feel better. If the person does not finish taking all of the antibiotics, the infection may come back.",2

"urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common type of infection, which often affects the bladder and can spread to the kidneys. UTIs can cause a range of symptoms, including pain and burning when urinating, a need to urinate more frequently than normal, blood in the urine, and pain in the lower back or side. UTIs can be treated with antibiotics, and most people make a full recovery.UTIs are caused by bacteria entering the urinary tract. This can happen when bacteria from the rectum or vagina spread to the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body) and travel up to the bladder. UTIs can also be caused by bacteria from the environment entering the urinary tract.UTIs are more common in women than in men, as the female urinary tract is closer to the anus and the vagina. Women are also more likely to get a UTI if they have sex frequently or if they have a history of UTIs.UTIs can be treated with antibiotics. For mild cases, a short course of antibiotics, such as trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin, may be all that is needed. For more severe cases, a longer course of antibiotics may be necessary.",2

", scrapes and bruisesHi, this is Sarah. Today I'm going to be talking about small cuts, scrapes and bruises.When it comes to cuts, the most important thing is to stop the bleeding. You can do this by pressing a clean cloth against the cut for a few minutes. If the cut is more than a quarter inch deep, was done with a dirty object, or bone is visible, then you'll need to seek medical attention.Scrapes are basically just small cuts on the surface of the skin. They can be treated in the same way as cuts, by applying pressure to the wound to stop the bleeding.Bruises happen when the blood vessels under the skin are damaged. This will cause blood to seep into the surrounding tissue, resulting in a black and blue mark. Bruises typically go away on their own within two weeks. However, if you have a bruise that doesn't go away after a few weeks, or if it's accompanied by other symptoms, then you should seek medical attention.That's all for today. Thanks for watching.",2

If you're being stung by a bee, for example, then remove the stinger as quickly as possible. If you're being bitten by a mosquito, then use a tissue or your hand to swat the insect away.After the source has been removed, you can then apply a cold compress to the area. This will help to reduce inflammation and swelling. You can also take an over-the-counter pain reliever to help ease any discomfort.If you have any other questions or concerns, don't hesitate to contact your doctor.",2

"and antibiotic usageUTI is the most common type of infection in patients who are receiving care in a hospital setting; UTIs often result from the use of indwelling urinary catheters. Additional risk factors for developing a UTI include advanced age, severity of illness, and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.The most common symptoms of a UTI are increased frequency and urgency of urination, accompanied by a burning sensation while urinating. UTIs can be diagnosed through a urinalysis, in which the presence of white blood cells and bacteria can indicate an infection.If a patient is diagnosed with a UTI, he or she will likely be prescribed antibiotics. The most common antibiotics used to treat UTIs include nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Most UTIs respond well to these antibiotics, and patients typically see a resolution of symptoms within a few days.However, if a patient does not respond to initial antibiotics, or if the patient has a more serious form of UTI, he or she may be prescribed a broader-spectrum antibiotic. This antibiotic will have a higher risk of causing side effects, such as nausea",2
